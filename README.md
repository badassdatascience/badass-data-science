# Badass Data Science

This repository contains multiple skills demonstrations--to assist my employment search--as well as code supporting my "Badass Data Science" blog (badassdatascience.com).

Note: The Badass Data Science blog is currently down for refactoring; I'll republish it soon.

## Getting the code to run

You'll first need to define the root location of this repository using the "BDS_HOME" e.g.:

- export BDS_HOME=/home/user/Desktop/projects/badassdatascience
